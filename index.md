# About me

I am a Research Fellow at the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Salerno (A.D. GEO/04 – Physical Geography and Geomorphology) since January 2022, where I am currently also lecturer of General Geology and Geomorphology. In 2015 I obtained my master's degree with honors in Engineering Geology, Land Use Management and Georisks at Sapienza University of Rome. In 2016 I was qualified as Professional Geologist (Regional Register of Campania, Section A). In 2020 I obtained a PhD in Earth Sciences from the Sapienza University of Rome defending the thesis entitled: "Integration of object-oriented modelling and geomorphometric methodologies for the analysis of landslide systems" (A.D. GEO/05 – Engineering Geology, Supervisor: Prof. Francesca Bozzano, co-supervisors: Proff. Marta Della Seta, and Domenico Guida). In 2021 I had a post-doc contract at the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Salerno for the Academic Disciplines GEO/04 and GEO/05.

My main research topics are focused on the study of the interactions between landslide phenomena in geologically complex contexts, GIScience topics about data structures for geospatial information related to geological risks.
